Ses \u0153uvres les plus connues sont 5 concertos pour piano, 9 sonates pour piano termin\u00e9es et 7 symphonies. Outre de nombreuses autres \u0153uvres, Prokofiev a \u00e9galement compos\u00e9 la Marche de l'Amour des trois oranges, la suite Lieutenant Kij\u00e9, le ballet Rom\u00e9o et Juliette et Pierre et le loup.\nDipl\u00f4m\u00e9 du Conservatoire de Saint-P\u00e9tersbourg, Prokofiev s'est d'abord fait un nom en tant que compositeur-pianiste iconoclaste, atteignant la notori\u00e9t\u00e9 avec une s\u00e9rie d'\u0153uvres f\u00e9rocement dissonantes et virtuoses pour son instrument et ses deux premiers concertos pour piano. \nApr\u00e8s la R\u00e9volution, Prokofiev a quitt\u00e9 la Russie avec la b\u00e9n\u00e9diction officielle du ministre sovi\u00e9tique Anatoly Lunacharsky, et il a v\u00e9cu aux \u00c9tats-Unis, en Allemagne. Prokofiev est retourn\u00e9 en Russie en 1936. Il y a connu un certain succ\u00e8s - notamment avec le lieutenant Kij\u00e9, Peter et le Loup, Rom\u00e9o et Juliette, et peut-\u00eatre surtout avec Alexander Nevsky. L'invasion nazie de l'URSS l'a incit\u00e9 \u00e0 composer son \u0153uvre la plus ambitieuse, une version lyrique de Guerre et Paix de L\u00e9on Tolsto\u00ef. En 1948, Prokofiev a \u00e9t\u00e9 critiqu\u00e9 pour son \"formalisme antid\u00e9mocratique\" et, avec ses revenus fortement r\u00e9duits, a \u00e9t\u00e9 contraint de composer des \u0153uvres staliniennes. Cependant, il a \u00e9galement b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 du soutien personnel et artistique d'une nouvelle g\u00e9n\u00e9ration d'artistes russes, notamment Sviatoslav Richter et Mstislav Rostropovich et pour ce dernier, il a compos\u00e9 sa Symphonie-Concerto.","strBiographyCN":null,"strBiographyIT":"Sergei Sergeyevich Prokofiev (pron.: /pr\u0259\u02c8k\u0252fi\u025bv/; Russian: \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0444\u044c\u0435\u0432; 23 April 1891 \u2013 5 March 1953) was a Russian composer, pianist and conductor who mastered numerous musical genres and is regarded as one of the major composers of the 20th century.
