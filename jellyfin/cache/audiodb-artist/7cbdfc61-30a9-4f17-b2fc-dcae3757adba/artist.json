Edelman has composed many memorable soundtracks of the last twenty years, including \"Gettysburg\", \"Last of the Mohicans\" and \"Dragonheart\".  Edelman attended the Cincinnati Music Conservatory, before heading to New York where he played piano in Broadway pit orchestras. He produced several solo albums of songs (some of which were later recorded by The Carpenters (\"I Can't Make Music\"), Barry Manilow, Olivia Newton-John and others) before moving to Los Angeles. It was there where Edelman started to work in TV and film scoring. In the mid 1980s, Edelman wrote the theme to, and scored many episodes of MacGyver, a popular television series starring Richard Dean Anderson.  During the 80s and early 90s he also collaborated with Ivan Reitman producing scores for several of his comedies including \"Ghostbusters II\", \"Twins\", \"Angels in the Outfield\", and \"Kindergarten Cop\". While some of the films scored by Edelman were not commercial successes, the music was often reused elsewhere. Themes he wrote for \"Dragonheart\", \"Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story\", \"Gettysburg\" and other films have been widely used in TV advertising and film trailers.","strBiographyDE":null,"strBiographyFR":null,"strBiographyCN":null,"strBiographyIT":null,"strBiographyJP":null,"strBiographyRU":null,"strBiographyES":null,"strBiographyPT":null,"strBiographySE":null,"strBiographyNL":null,"strBiographyHU":null,"strBiographyNO":null,"strBiographyIL":null,"strBiographyPL":null,"strGender":null,"intMembers":null,"strCountry":null,"strCountryCode":"US","strArtistThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/thumb/uvpqxy1404030155.jpg","strArtistLogo":null,"strArtistCutout":null,"strArtistClearart":null,"strArtistWideThumb":null,"strArtistFanart":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/fanart/ypyvvt1404030174.jpg","strArtistFanart2":null,"strArtistFanart3":null,"strArtistFanart4":null,"strArtistBanner":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"7cbdfc61-30a9-4f17-b2fc-dcae3757adba","strISNIcode":null,"strLastFMChart":null,"intCharted":"3","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
