Pla has also collaborated in film productions such as \u201cAirbag\u201d, directed by Juanma Bajo Ulloa; Isabel Coixet\u2019s \u201cA los que aman\u201d (To Those Who Love); and \u201cHonor de cavalleria\u201d (Honour of Chivalry) by Albert Serra. He also played a prominent role in Helmut Krausser\u2019s play \u201cCaracuero\u201d (Leatherface) in over 150 performances.
