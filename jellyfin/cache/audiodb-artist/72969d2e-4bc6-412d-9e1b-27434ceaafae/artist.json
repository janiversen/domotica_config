The group name refers to the Tabajara, indigenous people who lived on the easternmost portion of the Atlantic coast of northeast Brazil in the period before and during Portuguese colonization, in the 16th century.\nProbably as early as 1943, RCA's Latin American arm signed them to a recording contract. In the early 1950s, they took a break from performing and went back to study the guitar. After returning to the stage later that same decade, they took on the name \"Los Indios Tabajaras\" and released an album in the United States on an RCA-owned label Vox.","strBiographyDE":null,"strBiographyFR":null,"strBiographyCN":null,"strBiographyIT":null,"strBiographyJP":null,"strBiographyRU":null,"strBiographyES":null,"strBiographyPT":null,"strBiographySE":null,"strBiographyNL":null,"strBiographyHU":null,"strBiographyNO":null,"strBiographyIL":null,"strBiographyPL":null,"strGender":"Male","intMembers":"2","strCountry":"Cear\u00e1, Brazil","strCountryCode":"BR","strArtistThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/thumb/vb0wxp1606324562.jpg","strArtistLogo":null,"strArtistCutout":null,"strArtistClearart":null,"strArtistWideThumb":null,"strArtistFanart":null,"strArtistFanart2":null,"strArtistFanart3":null,"strArtistFanart4":null,"strArtistBanner":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"72969d2e-4bc6-412d-9e1b-27434ceaafae","strISNIcode":null,"strLastFMChart":null,"intCharted":"0","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
