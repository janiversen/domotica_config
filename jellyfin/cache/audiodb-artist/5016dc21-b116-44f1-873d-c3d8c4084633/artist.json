On the other hand, we have some information related to his talent as a violist, thanks to his students, including Danoville, Jean Desfontaines, Marin Marais, Pierre M\u00e9liton and Jean Rousseau.\nIt is probable that it is at the origin of the addition of a seventh string to the bass of viol. Jean Rousseau indicates that he mastered the art of the viol \"to perfection\", is taken again in the work of Pascal Quignard, Every morning of the world (as well as in the film of the same name) which shows the learning of Marin Marais near Sainte-Colombe, and in which he is presented as an austere man. He probably belonged to the nobility of the neighborhood of Pau, and it is reported that he gave at his concerts viol. He was not a court musician.\nWith one hundred and seventy-seven pieces for solo viola and sixty-seven for two violas, Sainte-Colombe proves to be a prolific composer. Among the compositions that have come down to us, Concerts with two violas esgales (score discovered by the pianist Alfred Cortot and found among his papers in 1966). One can have, through these compositions, an idea of \u200b\u200bthe virtuosity of this master.\nHis son, also a violist, wrote a tomb in memory of his father.","strBiographyDE":null,"strBiographyFR":"Jean de Sainte-Colombe, ou Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe, est un c\u00e9l\u00e8bre compositeur et violoniste fran\u00e7ais, n\u00e9 vers 1640 et mort vers 1700.
