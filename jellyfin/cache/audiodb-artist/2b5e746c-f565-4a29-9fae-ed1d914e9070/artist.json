Bravo was born near Valencia. The son of a salesman, he moved to Valencia at the age of three, along his father, who went to Valencia to look for better economic opportunities, and the rest of his family.  Nino Bravo was a shy child. He had a tendency to befriend older people, and, in 1958, he met bassist Vicente Lopez. Lopez later on helped Bravo become friends with other Valencia musicians, such as Paco Ramon, who later on also went on to become a Spaniard musical legend.  Bravo had no idea, before meeting Lopez, that his singing voice would be liked by anyone. He and Lopez discovered his singing voice during a short trip that Bravo, Lopez and Ramon, among others, went on. The trip was supposed to be just a hang-out trip between friends; Lopez was surprised as he awoke from a nap to Bravo's voice as Bravo sang Domenico Modugno's hit \"Libero\". So impressed was Lopez by Bravo's voice, that he predicted Bravo would become a superstar right after awakening.  Nino Bravo soon began working as a jeweler and supermarket assistant. The supermarket where he worked at was owned by his mother. When Bravo was sixteen, he became a fan of the famous Chilean singer Antonio Prieto, whose song, \"La Novia\" (\"The Bride\"), had become a number one hit in Spain. Bravo and his friends made an attempt at recording this song, forming a band and calling themselves \"Los Hispanicos\" (not to be confused with \"Los Hispanos\", a far more famous group). The attempt to have their own version of \"La Novia\" failed.  Bravo also was a Rock & Roll music fan. Soon after, he found a job singing at a hotel, where he would sing one of his favorite English songs, \"Only You\". Bravo was approached by a recording company agent who tried to convince him to sign with his label. He declined, because he felt unconfortable that only he, and not the rest of \"Los Hispanicos\", would be featured in the album.  In 1964, \"Los Hispanicos\" changed their name to \"Los Superson\", and, with this, their luck changed a little, as they won a local radio contest, then moved on to Benidorm, where they built a relatively large base of female fans. Bravo was called for military duty, however, and he went through a bout of depression. He almost decided to quit his singing career during this period of his life.  During Bravo's time away in the military, Lopez befriended a radio personality, who was impressed by \"Los Superson\"s sound and wanted them signed. \"The Superson\"s album debut would have been nothing but two songs included in another singer's LP. But, that time around, it was Lopez who declined being signed, based on the fact that he wanted his friend and band's leader to be in the album as well.  When Bravo returned from the service, Lopez was so enthusiastic, that the radio host asked him if he thought Bravo could sing like Tom Jones, Engelbert Humperdinck or John Rowles. Upon hearing Bravo's voice, however, the radio man was impressed too.  The radio host, Miguel Suiran, took Bravo to a singing festival. Although Bravo did not win the festival, Suiran became convinced that it was time for Bravo to become a star on his own, and, soon after, Suiran came up with the artistic name of Nino Bravo.  Bravo and Suiran tried for Bravo to be signed by the RCA label; although Bravo got some RCA executives interested in signing him, the label, ultimately led by a decision made by one executive, declined to sign Bravo. Bravo and Suiran then went to the Fonogram recording studio, where executives asked the pair to await a couple of weeks to see if they wanted to sign Bravo. Both RCA and Fonogram's studios were located in Madrid.  Back in Valencia, Suiran published a newspaper ad announcing \"Nino Bravo y Los Superson\". Soon after, Fonogram called, letting Bravo and Suiran know that they had decided to sign Bravo and \"Los Superson\" to an album deal.  In March of 1969, shortly after their album hit the market, Bravo sang in front of a live audience for the first time. In a show of fan support, a large number of admirers tore off Bravo's concert posters after his first concert was over.  Fonogram wanted Bravo to go solo, and by 1970, Suiran had been substituted by Jose Meri as Bravo's manager.  That year, Bravo participated at the prestigious Barcelona music festival, but, once again, he did not win. It would be two other festivals, however, what would lead Bravo to obtain international fame: after receiving favoring reviews from a festival audience in Athens, Greece, he went on to impress the public at another festival, the Rio de Janeiro festival.  After being exposed to international audiences in Europe and Latin America, he went through another change in management, as the famous singers' manager, Augusto Alguero, relieved Jose Meri from his duties. Bravo's first solo album was soon released, and his song, \"Te Quiero, te quiero...\", went on to become an international hit that is now considered to be a classic song by many Hispanic music critics. Bravo's first album was named \"Tu Cambiaras\" (\"You Will Change\"), and it sold in large numbers, particularly in Colombia, where Bravo became a very popular singer.  Nino Bravo then spent ten weeks in a row singing in the Spaniard television show, \"Pasaporte a Dublin\" (\"Passport to Dublin)\". The winner of the show would represent Spain in 1971's Eurovision contest, and Bravo came in second place.  Bravo then went on another Latin American tour, visiting Colombia for the first time ever, and stopping in Brazil to participate in his second Rio de Janeiro festival. Tied for first place at the festival, he eventually lost during a recount to an American singer.  Also in 1971, Nino Bravo recorded his second album, which went untitled. The album would later on be posthumously released on CD format and named \"Puerta de amor\" (\"Love's Door\").  In 1972, Bravo launched his third album, \"Libre\" (\"Free\"). \"Libre\" proved to be both a huge success and a very controversial album for Bravo, as many Latin American dictators of the time banned the album's title song from being played in their countries, and, as a consequence, Bravo was also banned from singing them in certain countries. Bravo's success, however, was such that he was widely known in places like Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Puerto Rico Venezuela and among the Hispanic population of the United States.  In January of 1973, his daughter Amparo was born. A second daughter, Eva, would later arrive, but Nino never got to see her.  Some of the words that Nino Bravo said in 1973 proved to be tragically prophetic: talking about his last Latin American tour, he referred to a song named \"Noelia\" as \"(his) last song\". Another song that he released that same year, \"Un Beso y una Flor\" (\"A Kiss and a Flower\") became one of Bravo's largest international hits. Loosely translated into English, the song's chorus would say \"A Kiss and a Flower during my good-bye\". On March 14 of that year, he performed his last concert, in front of his Valencia fans.  Nino Bravo was on his way to Madrid driving his BMW 2800 with a singing duo on April 16 when he was involved in a car accident just outside of Spain's capital city. He died instantly as a consequence of the injuries suffered during the accident. Bravo had just signed a five year record deal with the European record company, Polydor.","strBiographyDE":null,"strBiographyFR":null,"strBiographyCN":null,"strBiographyIT":null,"strBiographyJP":null,"strBiographyRU":null,"strBiographyES":"(Luis Manuel Ferri Llopis; Ayelo de Malferit, Valencia, 1944 - Villarrubio, 1973) Cantante espa\u00f1ol, considerado hasta su temprana y tr\u00e1gica muerte como la mejor voz del pop nacional en el final de la d\u00e9cada de los sesenta y principios de los setenta. Su estilo, a caballo entre la interpretaci\u00f3n est\u00e1ndar (habitual en la mayor\u00eda de int\u00e9rpretes de su generaci\u00f3n) y el pop del momento, conquist\u00f3 a un p\u00fablico mayoritario, no s\u00f3lo por la alta calidad de su repertorio, sino tambi\u00e9n por la potencia y belleza de una voz que le diferenciaba definitivamente de sus numerosos imitadores.\nDesde la temprana edad de cuatro a\u00f1os creci\u00f3 en el barrio de Sagunto de Valencia. Admirador desde siempre de Luis Mariano (tanto como tiempo despu\u00e9s lo ser\u00eda de Tom Jones) tuvo sus primeros contactos con la m\u00fasica ligera cuando, muy joven a\u00fan, form\u00f3 parte del tr\u00edo semi-profesional Los Hisp\u00e1nicos, para pasar despu\u00e9s a integrar Los Superson, con quienes comenz\u00f3 a actuar con cierta frecuencia en fiestas y locales de verano de la Comunidad Valenciana.\n\nEn marzo de 1969 realiz\u00f3 su presentaci\u00f3n en el Teatro Principal de Valencia con un repertorio en el que destacaban versiones de los \u00e9xitos del momento, basadas principalmente en canciones de Tom Jones, Engelbert Humperdinck y John Rowles. Las buenas cr\u00edticas recibidas le animaron a suscribir contrato por cinco a\u00f1os con el sello Fonogram, a raz\u00f3n de un fijo de cinco mil pesetas por canci\u00f3n grabada y un 4% de royalties de las ventas de sus discos.\n\nEl single de debut conten\u00eda dos temas del prestigioso autor Manuel Alejandro (\"Como todos\" y \"Es el viento\"), aunque el \u00e9xito llegar\u00eda en el verano de 1970, con el tema \"Te quiero, te quiero\", de Rafael de Le\u00f3n y Augusto Alguer\u00f3. Fue su primer n\u00famero uno de ventas en Espa\u00f1a y una de las canciones m\u00e1s populares del a\u00f1o en toda Sudam\u00e9rica. El \u00e9xito continuar\u00eda con \"Noelia\", y en meses sucesivos su presencia comenz\u00f3 a ser habitual en programas de televisi\u00f3n y festivales como el de R\u00edo de Janeiro o Atenas.\n\nTras la edici\u00f3n de su primer \u00e1lbum en 1970, su popularidad creci\u00f3 de manera imponente. En 1972 comenz\u00f3 a colaborar con el equipo de autores formado por Jos\u00e9 Luis Armenteros y Pablo Herreros, quienes le proporcionaron dos nuevos \u00e9xitos en su carrera, \"Un beso y una flor\" y \"Libre\", temas compuestos especialmente pensando en las caracter\u00edsticas de la voz del int\u00e9rprete valenciano.\n\nPero justo en el momento en el que Nino Bravo alcanzaba su madurez como artista, un accidente de tr\u00e1fico acab\u00f3 con su vida en abril de 1973. La noticia trascendi\u00f3 m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de su nutrido grupo de admiradores y le convirti\u00f3 en un mito, cuyo prestigio se mantiene hasta la actualidad. Su canci\u00f3n \"Am\u00e9rica, Am\u00e9rica\" alcanz\u00f3 de nuevo el n\u00famero uno despu\u00e9s de su fallecimiento y, en adelante, las reediciones de sus grabaciones han mantenido vivo su recuerdo.\n\nA finales de 1995, su discogr\u00e1fica de siempre (que nunca tuvo la ocasi\u00f3n de ver cumplido aquel primer contrato de cinco a\u00f1os firmado por el artista) public\u00f3 un \u00e1lbum homenaje para celebrar el cincuenta aniversario del nacimiento del cantante. El compositor y arreglista Juan Carlos Calder\u00f3n revis\u00f3 los temas m\u00e1s populares del repertorio de Nino Bravo y gest\u00f3 un \u00e1lbum doble donde redigitaliz\u00f3 veinticuatro canciones e hizo arreglos nuevos de otras seis que fueron incorporadas como duetos del artista fallecido y destacadas estrellas de la m\u00fasica espa\u00f1ola de los noventa. Los elegidos fueron Paloma San Basilio (\"Te quiero, te quiero\"), El Consorcio (\"Am\u00e9rica, Am\u00e9rica\"), Francisco (\"Libre\"), Javier Andreu de La Frontera (\"Un beso y una flor\"), Sergio Dalma (\"Cartas amarillas\") y Lolita (\"Esa ser\u00e1 mi casa\").\n\nEl resultado tuvo tanto \u00e9xito que, dos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, Calder\u00f3n prepar\u00f3 un segundo volumen doble, Duetos 2, corrigiendo y aumentando su anterior revisi\u00f3n. Esta vez los duetos fueron siete y los elegidos para interpretarlos Eva Ferri, Marcos Llunas, Sandra Morey, el D\u00fao Din\u00e1mico, Mocedades, Raphael y Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso. Adem\u00e1s Calder\u00f3n compuso \"Dicen\", un homenaje in memoriam del m\u00fasico desaparecido cantado por los artistas citados, salvo el D\u00fao Din\u00e1mico, a los que se a\u00f1adieron Michelle y Mar\u00eda Caneda. Como atractivo extra, este segundo volumen incluy\u00f3 la recuperaci\u00f3n remasterizada de dos temas poco conocidos de Nino Bravo: \"Te amar\u00e1\" y \"\u00bfQui\u00e9n eres t\u00fa?\", que en su momento s\u00f3lo se editaron en el antol\u00f3gico Grandes voces en espa\u00f1ol.\n\nM\u00e1s sincero y menos cremat\u00edstico pareci\u00f3 el homenaje que diversos paisanos de Nino Bravo le ofrecieron a finales de los noventa; sobre todo el grupo Seguridad Social con su versi\u00f3n rockera de \"Libre\", o El Chaval de la Peca en una versi\u00f3n pop del mismo tema que tambi\u00e9n fue utilizada en un anuncio de televisi\u00f3n de una empresa de telefon\u00eda m\u00f3vil.","strBiographyPT":null,"strBiographySE":null,"strBiographyNL":null,"strBiographyHU":null,"strBiographyNO":null,"strBiographyIL":null,"strBiographyPL":null,"strGender":"Male","intMembers":"1","strCountry":"Ayelo de Malferit, Valencia","strCountryCode":"ES","strArtistThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/thumb/vsvpww1399118481.jpg","strArtistLogo":null,"strArtistCutout":null,"strArtistClearart":null,"strArtistWideThumb":null,"strArtistFanart":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/fanart/srtrsp1438649116.jpg","strArtistFanart2":null,"strArtistFanart3":null,"strArtistFanart4":null,"strArtistBanner":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"2b5e746c-f565-4a29-9fae-ed1d914e9070","strISNIcode":null,"strLastFMChart":null,"intCharted":"4","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
