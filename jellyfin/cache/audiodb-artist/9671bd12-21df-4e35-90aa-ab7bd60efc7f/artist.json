Paoli was born in Monfalcone, but moved very early to Genoa.  After several different jobs, he was called by Ricordi with his friends Luigi Tenco and Bruno Lauzi. His first success was the single \"La gatta\". This was followed by \"Sapore di sale\", arranged by Ennio Morricone. In the same year he attempted suicide by shooting at his heart, but he survived.  In 1974 he returned with the LP I semafori rossi non sono Dio, followed by Il mio mestiere (1977). Both showed a more mature inspiration than his 1960s works. In the 1980s Paoli procuded a series of successful albums, and in 1985 he toured Italy together with Ornella Vanoni.  In 1987 he was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies for the Italian Communist Party. He abandoned politics in 1992.  He was married with actress Stefania Sandrelli, from whom he divorced.
