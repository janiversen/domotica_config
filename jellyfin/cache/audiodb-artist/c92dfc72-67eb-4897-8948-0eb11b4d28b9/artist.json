His father, who was a social worker, had started a program of steelpan playing for at-risk youth at the Jewish philanthropic Education Alliance in Lower East Side Manhattan using two sets of pans made by Rupert Sterling, a native of Antigua. Beginning in 1962, Andy, his brother Jeff, and three others boys played on a third set of Sterling-made pans in the basement of the Narell house in the Whitestone neighborhood of Queens, calling themselves the Steel Bandits. The band was a novelty steelpan act that played concerts and appeared on television shows, including I've Got a Secret in 1963.","strBiographyDE":null,"strBiographyFR":null,"strBiographyCN":null,"strBiographyIT":null,"strBiographyJP":null,"strBiographyRU":null,"strBiographyES":null,"strBiographyPT":null,"strBiographySE":null,"strBiographyNL":null,"strBiographyHU":null,"strBiographyNO":null,"strBiographyIL":null,"strBiographyPL":null,"strGender":"Male","intMembers":"1","strCountry":"American","strCountryCode":"US","strArtistThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/thumb/qqtrrw1578760596.jpg","strArtistLogo":null,"strArtistCutout":null,"strArtistClearart":null,"strArtistWideThumb":null,"strArtistFanart":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/fanart/lxge1j1631519581.jpg","strArtistFanart2":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/fanart/6xfjb41631520103.jpg","strArtistFanart3":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/fanart/m00cqz1631519823.jpg","strArtistFanart4":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/fanart/2ga3s91631519973.jpg","strArtistBanner":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"c92dfc72-67eb-4897-8948-0eb11b4d28b9","strISNIcode":null,"strLastFMChart":null,"intCharted":"0","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
