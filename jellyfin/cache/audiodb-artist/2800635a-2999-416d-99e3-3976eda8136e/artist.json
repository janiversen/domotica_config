Performing the ancient compositions also meant they had to reconstruct an arsenal of ancient instruments.\nThis ancient music was an important aspect of the group's live performances during a series of acclaimed international tours. Another well-known recording by the group is their 1976 disc Musique Arabo-Andalouse, which delves into the Hispanic-Moslem music of southern Spain and is credited with creating new interest in the genre. From the late 1970s to the early 1980s the group made a series of recordings dealing with 15th and 16th century popular Spanish songs, then shifted their attention to the New World for the album Las Indias de Espa\u00f1a, a recording of Pre-Columbian music collected from archives.\nThe group dissolved in the early 1980s. Several members, including Eduardo Paniagua, began solo careers.","strBiographyDE":null,"strBiographyFR":null,"strBiographyCN":null,"strBiographyIT":null,"strBiographyJP":null,"strBiographyRU":null,"strBiographyES":null,"strBiographyPT":null,"strBiographySE":null,"strBiographyNL":null,"strBiographyHU":null,"strBiographyNO":null,"strBiographyIL":null,"strBiographyPL":null,"strGender":"","intMembers":"1","strCountry":"Spanish","strCountryCode":"ES","strArtistThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/thumb/wyvupu1517363650.jpg","strArtistLogo":null,"strArtistCutout":null,"strArtistClearart":null,"strArtistWideThumb":null,"strArtistFanart":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/fanart/rupvrr1517363782.jpg","strArtistFanart2":null,"strArtistFanart3":null,"strArtistFanart4":null,"strArtistBanner":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"2800635a-2999-416d-99e3-3976eda8136e","strISNIcode":null,"strLastFMChart":null,"intCharted":"3","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
