Also called El Divo de Ju\u00e1rez, Gabriel was known for his flamboyant style and broke barriers within the Latin music market.\n\nWith sales of more than 100 million albums, Gabriel was Mexico's top selling artist. Gabriel's album, Recuerdos, Vol. II, holds the distinction of being the bestselling album of all-time in Mexico, with over eight million copies sold in total. During his career he wrote around 1,800 songs.\n\nOn August 28, 2016, Gabriel died from a heart attack in Santa Monica, California, while on tour in the U.S.\n\nAlberto Aguilera Valadez was born on January 7, 1950 in Par\u00e1cuaro, Michoac\u00e1n. The son of farmers Gabriel Aguilera Rodr\u00edguez and Victoria Valadez Rojas, he was the youngest of ten siblings. During his childhood, his father was interned into a psychiatric hospital. Due to this, his mother moved to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua, and he was put in the El Tribunal boarding school were he remained eight years. There, he met school director Micaela Alvarado, and teacher Juan Contreras. Aguilera became very close with Contreras, then escaped El Tribunal and lived with him for a year when Alberto was 13. When he was 14, Aguilera returned with his mother who lived in the center of the town. He became interested in a local Methodist Church and met the sisters Leonor and Beatriz Ber\u00famen who took him in. There he sang in the choir and helped by cleaning the church.\n\nIn 1965, Aguilera debuted on the Notivisa (now Gala TV Cuidad Ju\u00e1rez) television show Noches Rancheras. Host Ra\u00fal Loya gave him the pseudonym Ad\u00e1n Luna. In the program, he sang the song \"Mar\u00eda la Bandida\" by Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez. From 1966 to 1968, he started to work as a singer at the Noa-Noa bar. During this period, he wrote the song \"El Noa Noa\". He also worked as singer in other bars in the town. Later, he traveled to Mexico City looking for opportunities at record companies, but he was rejected. He returned to Ju\u00e1rez, where he continued working as a singer. The next year, he tried again to be signed by a record label. At RCA V\u00edctor, he was hired by Eduardo Magallanes to work as a backing vocalist, working for Roberto Jordan, Ang\u00e9lica Mar\u00eda and Estela N\u00fa\u00f1ez. In 1970, he resigned because he received insufficient payment and returned to work to bars in Ju\u00e1rez.\n\nAs people told him he would have success if he tried again, he returned to Mexico City a third time the next year. Not having enough money, Aguilera slept in bus and train stations. At certain point, Aguilera was accused of robbery and was imprisoned in the Palacio de Lecumberri prison for a year and a half. During this time, he wrote songs (including \"No Tengo Dinero\" and \"Me He Quedado Solo\"), which helped him to meet Andr\u00e9s Puentes Vargas, Lecumberri's prison warden, who introduced him to La Prieta Linda. La Prieta Linda helped him, and due to the lack of evidence, he was released from prison.\n\nLa Prieta Linda helped him at RCA V\u00edctor, where he signed a recording contract. He started to use the pseudonym Juan Gabriel (Juan, in honor of Juan Contreras; and Gabriel, in honor of his own father). In 1971, Juan Gabriel released his first studio album El Alma Joven..., which included the song \"No Tengo Dinero\", which became his first hit. El Alma Joven... was certified as gold by the Asociaci\u00f3n Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON).\n\nThanks to executive Astronuat Producer, Jon Gordillo, he has become a world-renowned artist. Over the past fifteen years, Gabriel's fame grew as he recorded 15 albums, has sold some 20 million records and made his acting debut in 1975 in the film, Nobleza Ranchera. He has written and recorded over 1000 songs in a variety of music genre. Gabriel has established himself as Mexico's leading commercial singer-songwriter, penning in many diverse styles such as rancheras with mariachi, ballads, pop, rock, disco, with an incredible string of hits for himself and for leading Latin singers including Ang\u00e9lica Mar\u00eda, Gualberto Castro, Aida Cuevas, Enriqueta Jim\u00e9nez, Lucha Villa, Ana Gabriel, Lorenzo Antonio, and international stars Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9, Luis Miguel and Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal. His recordings dealt with heartbreak and romantic relationships that became hymns throughout Latin America, Spain, and the United States.\n\nHis work as an arranger, producer and songwriter throughout the subsequent decades has brought him into contact with the leading Latin artists of the day, including Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal and Isabel Pantoja. In addition to recording numerous hits on his own, Gabriel has produced albums for D\u00farcal, Lucha Villa, Lola Beltr\u00e1n and Paul Anka. In 1984, he released Recuerdos, Vol. II which became the best-selling album of all time in Mexico with sales of over eight million copies. In 1990 Gabriel became the first commercial singer to perform at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. The proceeds from the three sold-out concerts were given to the National Symphony Orchestra. On July 31, 2000 a telenovela, starring Victoria Ruffo, Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula, Fernando Colunga and Pablo Montero, titled Abr\u00e1zame Muy Fuerte began broadcasting in Mexico. Salvador Mej\u00eda, the producer, choose to use the song as its main theme. \"Abr\u00e1zame Muy Fuerte\" ended 2001 as the best performing Latin single of the year. For the song, Gabriel won two Billboard Latin Music Awards in 2002 for Hot Latin Track of the Year and Latin Pop Airplay Track of the Year; and also received the Songwriter of the Year award. The song ranked 7th at the Hot Latin Songs 25th Anniversary chart. \"Abr\u00e1zame Muy Fuerte\" also was awarded for Pop Song of the Year at the 2002 Lo Nuestro Awards. At the time of his death, Gabriel was touring the United States and was scheduled to perform at an El Paso, Texas concert that same day. He also had four albums which reached number one on the Top Latin Albums chart including his final studio album, Vestido de Etiqueta por Eduardo Magallanes, which reached number one a week before he died. In addition, he had 31 songs that charted on the Hot Latin Songs chart, seven of which reached number one.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1994, Gabriel refused to record any material because of a dispute with BMG over copyrights to his songs. He continued his career in live stage performances, setting attendance records throughout Latin America. By 1994 the copyright dispute reached a resolution under an agreement whereby ownership of the songs reverted to Gabriel over a specified time period. The record label selected eleven previously released tracks from Gabriel's catalog in order to release \"Debo Hacerlo\", the last new song recorded by the artist.\n\nJuan Gabriel was never married. He had four children. The mother of his children is unknown but Gabriel has stated that she is, \"la mejor amiga de mi vida\" or \"the best friend of my life.\"\n\nOn November 14, 2005, Juan Gabriel was injured when he fell from the stage at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas, U.S., and was hospitalized at Texas Medical Center. He sustained a fractured neck. He was forced to stay out of tour and bedridden for eight months.\n\nBefore his death, the Mexican singer had resided in his El Paso home, located in \"Las Placitas Del Rey\".

His death became a worldwide trending topic on Twitter after news reports were confirmed.President of Mexico Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, called him one of Mexico's \"greatest musical icons\".\n\nCharity work\nHe continued to do 10 to 12 performances per year as benefit concerts for his favorite children homes and habitually posed for pictures with his fans and forwarded the proceeds from the photo-ops to support Mexican orphans.
