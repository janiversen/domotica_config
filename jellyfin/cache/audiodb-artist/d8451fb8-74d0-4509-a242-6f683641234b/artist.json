It is predominantly composed of Czech and Slovak classical and jazz musicians. The orchestra started out, after World War II, in 1947, as the in-house full orchestra regularly playing music for film, television and animation productions at the world famous Barrandov Film Studios, in Prague, as well as the historic Kr\u00e1tk\u00fd Film productions (meaning \"short film,\" in Czech), and the former Czechoslovak Television.\n\nAt the time, it was somewhat smaller than today and it was called the Filmov\u00fd symfonick\u00fd orchestr (FISYO) (The Film Symphony Orchestra) or was sometimes known as the Film Symphony of Prague. Many wonderful international films were done by this orchestra in the early days. Recordings have been made for film production companies such as Paramount, Sony, Lucasfilm and many others in the Smecky Music Studios. David Lynch returned again in 1997 to record his Lost Highway, and yet again in 2001 to record Mulholland Drive.\n\nFully privatized after the Velvet Revolution, today, the musicians and supporting professionals continue to play and record music together (usually every day of the week) for major international films, television series, CDs/DVDs, video games, and even ring tones - both for the Czech Republic market and for clients & media productions around the world.","strBiographyDE":null,"strBiographyFR":null,"strBiographyCN":null,"strBiographyIT":null,"strBiographyJP":null,"strBiographyRU":null,"strBiographyES":null,"strBiographyPT":null,"strBiographySE":null,"strBiographyNL":null,"strBiographyHU":null,"strBiographyNO":null,"strBiographyIL":null,"strBiographyPL":null,"strGender":"","intMembers":"1","strCountry":"","strCountryCode":"CZ","strArtistThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/thumb/rvpswr1533976203.jpg","strArtistLogo":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/logo/vxuvrv1533975723.png","strArtistCutout":null,"strArtistClearart":null,"strArtistWideThumb":null,"strArtistFanart":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/fanart/qwpusr1533976155.jpg","strArtistFanart2":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/fanart/ryypyy1533976174.jpg","strArtistFanart3":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/fanart/wutpts1533976187.jpg","strArtistFanart4":null,"strArtistBanner":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"d8451fb8-74d0-4509-a242-6f683641234b","strISNIcode":null,"strLastFMChart":null,"intCharted":"3","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
