They recorded from 1963 through 1975, and continued to perform until Hatfield's death in 2003. Their emotive vocal stylings were sometimes dubbed \"blue-eyed soul\".\nMedley and Hatfield both possessed exceptional vocal talent, with range, control and tone that helped them create a strong and distinctive duet sound and also to perform as soloists. Medley sang the low parts with his deep, soulful bass, with Hatfield taking the higher register vocals with his soaring tenor.\nThey adopted their name in 1962 while performing together in the Los Angeles area as part of a five-member group called The Paramours, which featured John Wimber (a founder of the Vineyard Movement) on keyboards. At the end of one particular performance, a U.S. Marine in the audience shouted, \"That was righteous, brothers!\", prompting the pair to adopt the name when they embarked on a career as a duo.","strBiographyDE":null,"strBiographyFR":null,"strBiographyCN":null,"strBiographyIT":null,"strBiographyJP":null,"strBiographyRU":null,"strBiographyES":null,"strBiographyPT":null,"strBiographySE":null,"strBiographyNL":null,"strBiographyHU":null,"strBiographyNO":null,"strBiographyIL":null,"strBiographyPL":null,"strGender":"Male","intMembers":"2","strCountry":"Los Angeles, USA","strCountryCode":"US","strArtistThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/thumb/uvrqqr1359114477.jpg","strArtistLogo":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/logo/righteous-brothers-the-52b243c1bfa98.png","strArtistCutout":null,"strArtistClearart":null,"strArtistWideThumb":null,"strArtistFanart":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/fanart/0re2fs1633359216.jpg","strArtistFanart2":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/fanart/h8ghw51633359362.jpg","strArtistFanart3":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/fanart/ly7wob1633359457.jpg","strArtistFanart4":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/fanart/oul1771633359508.jpg","strArtistBanner":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/banner/righteous-brothers-the-589d191e5ca3c.jpg","strMusicBrainzID":"1ac3366a-a0e9-4a55-8f6e-796fce32a3b2","strISNIcode":null,"strLastFMChart":null,"intCharted":"3","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
