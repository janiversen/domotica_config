Their first drummer was the late Bj\u00f8rn Uglebjerg. He was replaced by S\u00f8ren Berlev in 1971. At the formation the guitar playing of Franz Beckerlee was inspired by Jimi Hendrix and the singing and lyrics of Larsen was inspired by Bob Dylan, while the rhythm playing of J\u00f8nsson and Berlev owed much to The Beatles. However, they would soon develop their own musical style. The pop sensibility of Kim Larsen, the artistic attitude of Franz Beckerlee and the musical competence of Wili J\u00f8nsson would prove to be a recipe for success. Gasolin's lyrics were generally written by the entire group, often with the assistance of friend Mogens Mogensen.","strBiographyDE":null,"strBiographyFR":null,"strBiographyCN":null,"strBiographyIT":null,"strBiographyJP":null,"strBiographyRU":null,"strBiographyES":null,"strBiographyPT":null,"strBiographySE":null,"strBiographyNL":null,"strBiographyHU":null,"strBiographyNO":null,"strBiographyIL":null,"strBiographyPL":null,"strGender":"","intMembers":"1","strCountry":"","strCountryCode":"","strArtistThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/thumb/vprquw1365947797.jpg","strArtistLogo":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/logo/rrxyrt1389731432.png","strArtistCutout":null,"strArtistClearart":null,"strArtistWideThumb":null,"strArtistFanart":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/fanart/gasolin-50f854ed639b2.jpg","strArtistFanart2":null,"strArtistFanart3":null,"strArtistFanart4":null,"strArtistBanner":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/artist/banner/xxtpqq1389736928.jpg","strMusicBrainzID":"7d81cd10-5586-48ad-99cd-d4ff92124b48","strISNIcode":null,"strLastFMChart":null,"intCharted":"4","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
