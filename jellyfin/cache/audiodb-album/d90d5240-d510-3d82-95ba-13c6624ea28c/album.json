It is her fifth English-language album and twenty-third in total. Let's Talk About Love remains one of the best-selling albums in history with over 31 million copies sold worldwide. It includes the Grammy and Academy Award winning song, \"My Heart Will Go On\", which also served as the main theme song of the 1997 blockbuster film, Titanic. The song reached number-one across the world, and became the most successful song of Dion's career.\nLet's Talk About Love / Falling into You / A New Day Has Come 3-CD set was released in October 2007. Later, it was re-packaged and released in a reusable gift box on September 29, 2009, titled The Collection. Also on October 2, 2009 Let's Talk About Love / A New Day Has Come 2-CD set was released. C\u00e9line Dion followed up her smash-hit album Falling into You with Let's Talk About Love, which she publicized as its sequel. The recording process took place in London, New York, and Los Angeles, and featured a host of special guests: Barbra Streisand on \"Tell Him\", the Bee Gees on \"Immortality\", and world-renowned tenor Luciano Pavarotti on \"I Hate You Then I Love You\". Other musicians included Carole King and Sir George Martin - the famous The Beatles producer on \"The Reason\", Bryan Adams and Jean-Jacques Goldman (a famous French-singer) on \"Let's Talk About Love\", and Jamaican singer Diana King, who added a reggae tinge to \"Treat Her Like a Lady\". \"Is Nothing Sacred\" is one of the songs which originally had to be include on Dion's album but it had been removed and replaced by the ballad \"Where Is The Love\". \"Is Nothing Sacred\" is written by Jim Steinman.\nThe most successful single from the album became the classically influenced ballad \"My Heart Will Go On\", which was composed by James Horner, and produced by Horner and Walter Afanasieff. Serving as the love theme for the 1997 blockbuster film Titanic, the song topped the charts in most countries across the world, and has become Dion's signature song. It won an Academy Award for Best Original Song, four Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media, and many other awards around the world.
