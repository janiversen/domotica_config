It was released in Europe on October 25, 1996 by East West Records, and in the United States on January 28, 1997 by Atlantic Records. A single \"Song of the Seas\", with b-side \"Aquatic Dance\", was released simultaneously.\n\nVangelis was personally involved in the sleeve design, as he used to be in the late seventies and early eighties. At the end of the album inside liner notes there are references to the films Million Dollar Mermaid and Footlight Parade, presumably as sources of inspiration along the seas of the world as thematic basis.\n\nThe music was used in the 1998 documentary Deep Sea, Deep Secrets co-produced by The Learning Channel and Discovery Channel, together with music from Vangelis' previous album, Voices.\n\nIt was his first album nominated for a Grammy Award in Best New Age Album category. The second was the album Rosetta, in 2017.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"intLoved":null,"intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"strReview":"","strMood":"Dreamy","strTheme":"","strSpeed":"Medium","strLocation":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"517cd2fa-4cc1-3c90-ba95-9a4babd01c5e","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"57fca0e2-f9ad-4ae6-af9d-6a6f50cbcd5f","strAllMusicID":null,"strBBCReviewID":null,"strRateYourMusicID":null,"strDiscogsID":"12824","strWikidataID":"Q1316536","strWikipediaID":"Oceanic_(Vangelis_album)","strGeniusID":null,"strLyricWikiID":null,"strMusicMozID":null,"strItunesID":null,"strAmazonID":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
