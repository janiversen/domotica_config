Though less successful than any of The Police's albums, it managed to reach number 3 in the UK Album Charts.\nIt includes Sting's first hit after The Police (his first solo hit, \"Spread a Little Happiness\", was recorded while still a member of the Police), \"If You Love Somebody Set Them Free\". Though the song reached number 3 in the US, it was a relative flop in the UK, where the album's track \"Russians\" (about Cold War nuclear anxieties, which had peaked in the 1980s) proved more popular.\nThe movie Bring on the Night documents some of the recording work that produced this album, as well as the subsequent tour.\nThe album is named after a dream of Sting's.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"intLoved":null,"intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"strReview":"","strMood":"Good Natured","strTheme":null,"strSpeed":"","strLocation":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"93ef0ae1-0735-3699-b450-d79bdcb3d0b8","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"7944ed53-2a58-4035-9b93-140a71e41c34","strAllMusicID":"mw0000201855","strBBCReviewID":null,"strRateYourMusicID":"the_dream_of_the_blue_turtles","strDiscogsID":"32708","strWikidataID":"Q251023","strWikipediaID":"The_Dream_of_the_Blue_Turtles","strGeniusID":null,"strLyricWikiID":null,"strMusicMozID":null,"strItunesID":null,"strAmazonID":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
