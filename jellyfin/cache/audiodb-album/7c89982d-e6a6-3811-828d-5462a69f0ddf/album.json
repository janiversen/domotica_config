It is her fourth English-language album and twenty-first overall.\nAlthough the album received a mixed critical reception, Falling Into You won two Grammy Awards, for Best Pop Vocal Album and Album of the Year in 1997, and become one of the best-selling albums in history, with sales of over 32 million copies worldwide. It was listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers in their Definitive 200 Albums of All Time as the 97th most influential and popular album in history.\nLet's Talk About Love / Falling into You / A New Day Has Come 3CD set was released in October 2007. Later, it was repacked and released in a reusable gift box on September 29, 2009, titled The Collection. Also on October 2, 2009 Let's Talk About Love / A New Day Has Come 2CD set was released.\nFalling into You presented Dion at the height of her popularity, and showed a further progression of her music. In an attempt to reach a wider audience, the album combined many elements: ornate orchestral frills and African chanting, and instruments like the violin, Spanish guitar, trombone, the cavaquinho, saxophone and supreme string arrangements by Paul Buckmaster created a new sound. The singles encompassed a variety of musical styles: the title track and \"River Deep, Mountain High\" (a Tina Turner cover) made prominent use of percussion instruments; \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\" (a remake of Jim Steinman's song) and a remake of Eric Carmen's \"All by Myself\" kept their soft-rock atmosphere, but were combined with the classical sound of the piano; and the maudlin ballad, \"Because You Loved Me\", written by Diane Warren, served as the theme to the 1996 film Up Close & Personal. The song was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1996, as well as four Grammy Awards. C\u00e9line Dion performed at both ceremonies. The album included also Carole King's \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" and Marie Claire D'ubaldo's \"Falling into You.\"\n\"If That's What It Takes\", \"I Don't Know\", and \"Fly\" are the English adaptations of songs from the album D'eux.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"intLoved":null,"intScore":"10","intScoreVotes":"1","strReview":"","strMood":"In Love","strTheme":"","strSpeed":"Medium","strLocation":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"7c89982d-e6a6-3811-828d-5462a69f0ddf","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"847e8a0c-cc20-4213-9e16-975515c2a926","strAllMusicID":"mw0000647077","strBBCReviewID":null,"strRateYourMusicID":"falling_into_you","strDiscogsID":"134816","strWikidataID":"Q904457","strWikipediaID":null,"strGeniusID":null,"strLyricWikiID":null,"strMusicMozID":null,"strItunesID":null,"strAmazonID":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
